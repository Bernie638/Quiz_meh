# ðŸ“¤ Upload to GitHub - Manual Guide

Since the automated push failed, here's how to manually get your code to GitHub so Azure can deploy it.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Option 1: GitHub Desktop (Easiest)**

### **If you have GitHub Desktop:**
1. **Open GitHub Desktop**
2. **File** â†’ **Add Local Repository**
3. **Browse** to: `C:\Users\User\Quiz_meh\repo`
4. **Add Repository**
5. **Publish Repository** to GitHub
6. **Push** all your changes

### **If you don't have GitHub Desktop:**
[Download GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) - it makes this much easier!

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Option 2: Command Line (If you have Git configured)**

```bash
cd C:\Users\User\Quiz_meh\repo

# Configure your Git credentials (if not done already)
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

**If it asks for credentials:**
- Username: Your GitHub username
- Password: Your GitHub personal access token (not your password!)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Option 3: Upload via GitHub Web (Backup option)**

### **If other methods don't work:**

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and create a new repository
2. **Download your repo as ZIP**:
   ```bash
   # In your repo directory
   git archive --format=zip --output=nuclear-quiz.zip HEAD
   ```
3. **Upload the ZIP** to your new GitHub repository

---

## ðŸ”— **Connect Azure to GitHub**

Once your code is on GitHub:

### **1. In Azure Portal:**
- Go to your Static Web App: `nuclear-quiz-frontendbb2025`
- Click **"Deployment"** â†’ **"Source"**
- Choose **"GitHub"**
- **Connect your repository**

### **2. Configure Build:**
- **App location**: `/frontend`
- **API location**: *(leave blank)*
- **Output location**: `dist`

### **3. Automatic Deployment:**
- Azure will automatically build and deploy when you push to GitHub
- **No more manual uploads needed!**

## âœ… **What Happens After Upload**

### **Immediate:**
1. **Azure detects changes** in your GitHub repo
2. **Builds your frontend** using the fixed configuration
3. **Deploys automatically** to your Static Web App
4. **Site should load properly** (no more blank page!)

### **Expected Result:**
- âœ… **No MIME type errors**
- âœ… **React app loads correctly**
- âœ… **Topic selection works**
- âœ… **Quiz configuration works**
- âœ… **Your Wyoming team can access it**

## ðŸš€ **What's Been Fixed**

### **All Ready for Deployment:**
- âœ… **TypeScript errors fixed** (build succeeds)
- âœ… **MIME types configured** (fixes blank page)
- âœ… **Azure Static Web App config** optimized
- âœ… **GitHub Actions workflow** for automated deployment
- âœ… **Comprehensive quiz application** with all features

### **Your Application Includes:**

- **Progress tracking** and detailed analytics
- **Responsive design** (works on all devices)

---

## ðŸ“ž **Next Steps**
